            <p> Hey! It&apos;s me, Theresa, the creator of Joyberry Press.</p>
            
            <p> I currently live in a gorgeous little Boston suburb, but Ohio is where I have roots. I teach high school physics and coding by day and at night my artistic alter-ego is able to flourish. Has anyone come up with a way to only sleep four hours and still feel great? If so, please help a girl out! </p>
            
            <p> There are many things that bring me joy. I love baking fresh bread, visiting donut shops and science museums in new cities, getting psyched for Christmas six months early, eating as many sweets as my heart desires (I&apos;ve never felt guilty about calories, it&apos;s a blessing and a curse), and snuggling up with my cat, Sir Thomas The Chubbers or El Gato Diablo, depending on his mood. </p>

            <p> I&apos;m still finding my way. Not sure I will ever find it based on how quickly I like to take up new hobbies, but the journey is supposed to be the best part, right? When I am writing this I love the structure of geometric patterns and the flexibility of watercolor textures. If you want to know what I currently exploring, my Instagram is probably my most reliable source.  </p>
            
            <p> Remember to never take yourself too seriously and be confident in your experience. Happy creating! </p>

            <p> Growing up, I always loved being craftsy. As a kid I could color for hours at my coloring table and in high school I was known for creating my own Christmas cards to put in friend&apos;s lockers. I&apos;ve always loved creating, but I am very much a type A creative.</p>
            
            <p> Flash forward to two years out of college and I was mesmerized with calligraphers that I saw on Instagram. I decided to try my hand at calligraphy. With the help of <a target="_blank" href="https://thepostmansknock.com/product-category/learn-calligraphy/">The Postman Knocks</a> I downloaded her Amy style worksheets, ordered the supplies, and off I went. To be good at calligraphy you need to practice making the same motions over and over and over and over again. I may be type A, but I am not patient. Calligraphy was fun, but I never practiced enough to feel confident.</p>

            </div>
            
            <p> I then fell in love with watercolors. I loved to focus on blending colors with a wet on wet technique, adding salt to create texture, and mixing colors to create new colors. It seemed really hard to mess up, which was very encouraging for me as a beginner! </p>
            
            <p> Much to my husband&apos;s dismay, I tend to go from one hobby to the next. Watercolor has persisted since I started over a year ago, but I&apos;ve also dabbled in creating geometric designs on my iPad and incorporating them into laser cut paper cards and posters, designing acrylic laser cut jewelry, and I just started dabbling in book binding.</p>
            
            <p> In the past few years I&apos;ve spent a lot of money at Dick Blick, I&apos;ve made the signs for two of my friends weddings, I post regularly to an Instagram that I created to document my journey, I started my own Etsy and Society6 pages, and when a friend at our Makerspace asked if I was an artist, I hesitated and said yes. (Still feels weird.)</p>
