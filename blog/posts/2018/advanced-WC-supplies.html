          <p>Any time I start a new hobby I begin to accumulate a grocery list of supplies that I want. After spending some time on Instagram or Youtube, I typically find something I do not have and I can&apos;t stop thinking of all of the projects I could do with it. </p>
          
          <p>This blog post is a list of some of my favorite watercolor supplies. I call it an advanced list, because you by all means do not need these things to be on your own watercolor journey. If you are curious about my suggestions for beginning watercolor, check out my <a target="_blank" href="/blog/posts/2018/beginner-WC-supplies.html">Beginner Watercolor Supplies blog post</a></p>

          <h3> finetec paints </h3>
        
          <div class="image fit">
              <img src="/images/blog/advancedWCSupplies/finetec2.jpeg" alt="finetec2" />
          </div>
          
          <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XRZ4XJV/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B06XRZ4XJV&linkCode=as2&tag=theresariedl-20&linkId=67d616f3f3c475fa28a58caa32abfe66">Finetec Watercolors</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=theresariedl-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B06XRZ4XJV" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> are those gorgeous sparkling paints that you may have seen on Instagram. They are the go-to watercolor glitter paints. You can purchase these paints in either individual pans or as a set. I have the Pearlescent set of 6, which includes Arabic Gold, Bronze, Champagne Silver, Copper, Olympic Gold, and Silver. I absolutely love this set because it includes the main metallic colors that I wanted. </p>
          
          <div class="image fit">
              <img src="/images/blog/advancedWCSupplies/finetec3.jpeg" alt="finetec3" />
          </div>
          
          <p>I also purchased Mystic Color and Deep Black because I thought they would look really cool in galaxy paintings (which they do!). </p>
          
          <div class="image fit">
              <img src="/images/blog/advancedWCSupplies/finetec.jpeg" alt="finetec1" />
          </div>
          
          <p>Depending on how much water you add, these paints are perfect for adding a touch of shimmer or intense opaque color. They work great on both white and black papers!</p>
          
          <h3> metallic and white uni-ball signo gel pens </h3>
          
          <div class="image fit">
              <img src="/images/blog/advancedWCSupplies/signo1.jpeg" alt="signoGelPen" />
          </div>
          
          <p>If you are looking into purchasing a white or metallic pen to add accents to one of your pieces, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G1YFBA8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00G1YFBA8&linkCode=as2&tag=theresariedl-20&linkId=5efb8d92290f84807fe298f547d4c589">Signo Gel Pens</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=theresariedl-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B00G1YFBA8" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> are the only way to go. I&apos;ve tried other pens, and they just aren&apos;t opaque enough. They have a gold, silver, and white pens that are opaque and give great contrast to any piece. </p>
          
          <p>I&apos;ve used these pens in several line drawings videos that I&apos;ve posted to my Instagram and 75% of all of the comments I get on those videos are asking what pen I&apos;m using. </p>
          
          <p>If you look online there are other standard pens that fall under the Signo Gel Pen line, so to refine your search just add in gold, silver, or white into your search terms! Or just use the link above to buy one of each!</p>
          
          <h3> dr. ph martin's bleedproof white ink </h3>
          
          <div class="image fit">
              <img src="/images/blog/advancedWCSupplies/white1.jpeg" alt="white1" />
          </div>
          
          <p>Sometimes if I want to make my paints look a little more opaque, like guauche, or if I want to add in small white details I will use this Dr. Ph Martin's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008CRS1CM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B008CRS1CM&linkCode=as2&tag=theresariedl-20&linkId=9245de82397565e0b0975c65be10b725">Bleedproof White</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=theresariedl-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B008CRS1CM" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> Ink/paint. I originally purchased this for calligraphy with my dip pen on darker colored paper, but now I&apos;ve branched out and incorporated it into my watercoloring. </p>
          
          <div class="image fit">
              <img src="/images/blog/advancedWCSupplies/white2.jpeg" alt="white2" />
          </div>
          
          <p>It is super versatile and can be rehydrated and used again after it is dry. </p>
          
          <h3> micron pens </h3>
          
          <div class="image fit">
              <img src="/images/blog/advancedWCSupplies/micron1.jpeg" alt="micron1" />
          </div>
          
          <p>If you ever wanted to add some thin black lines to your painting or perhaps outline your painting before you start painting, it is so important that you use a waterproof ink. </p>
          
          <div class="image fit">
              <img src="/images/blog/advancedWCSupplies/micron2.jpeg" alt="micron2" />
          </div>
          
          <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008G8G8Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0008G8G8Y&linkCode=as2&tag=theresariedl-20&linkId=f1823e96db9b178268d5f88def6e506b">Micron</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=theresariedl-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B0008G8G8Y" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> pens are by far the most popular waterproof pens. They are really versatile and come in a bunch of different sizes. The 03 size is my favorite, but I suggest getting a variety pack if you are uncertain which thickness you may like. </p>
          
          <p>If you do smaller paintings you may want to go with a smaller pen size, so the black lines aren&apos;t overwhelming. If you paint on the larger size you may want to try out a larger pen. </p>
          
          <h3> frisket or masking fluid</h3>
          
          <div class="image fit">
              <img src="/images/blog/advancedWCSupplies/frisket2.jpeg" alt="frisket" />
          </div>
          
          <p>Frisket or masking fluid (same thing) is that magical substance that watercolor artists put on their paintings when they want a specific portion to stay free of paint. </p>
          
          <div class="image fit">
              <img src="/images/blog/advancedWCSupplies/frisket1.jpeg" alt="frisket" />
          </div>
          
          <p>There are a few different kinds of frisket or masking fluid. The first, by Prima,  is packaged with a small top that allows you to squeeze out the frisket wherever you want it. The second, by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005P1ROEY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005P1ROEY&linkCode=as2&tag=theresariedl-20&linkId=7600dffacc0f501397198d58fad6a05c">Winsor &amp; Newton </a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=theresariedl-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B005P1ROEY" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, comes in a bottle that you can then apply yourself. WARNING, do not put a paint brush into this unless you never want to use that paintbrush again! I typically like using the end of a paintbrush to apply the frisket, so that way the gummy dried frisket can easily be taken off.</p>
          
          <div class="image fit">
              <img src="/images/blog/advancedWCSupplies/frisket3.jpeg" alt="frisket" />
          </div>
          
          <p>Once applied, you will want to wait until it&apos;s a little gummy and then you can start painting. Once your paint is dry, you can use the side of your finger or an eraser to begin to peel up the frisket and reveal your clean paper underneath. </p>
          
          <p>It is super important that you don&apos;t leave the frisket on for too long (like overnight) because then the frisket may stain your paper or you may have trouble taking it off. </p>
          
          <h3> flat brushes </h3>
          
          <div class="image fit">
              <img src="/images/blog/advancedWCSupplies/flatbrush.JPG" alt="flat brush" />
          </div>
          
          <p>Typically watercolor artists use round brushes or a mop brush. These are great for creating varying thicknesses within a single brush stroke. I am a huge fan of clean straight lines, so I also started to incorporate flat brushes into my work.</p>
          
          <p>I have a few cheap <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000U68YJI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000U68YJI&linkCode=as2&tag=theresariedl-20&linkId=9a1d9d1b635fff565688e2e8147305f0">Loew-Cornell</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=theresariedl-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B000U68YJI" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> brushes from another project that I started out with, but then once I fell in love with them I invested in some from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OL5H1C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000OL5H1C&linkCode=as2&tag=theresariedl-20&linkId=fd32252b859d6952bfd74987f6d5dd42">Princeton</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=theresariedl-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B000OL5H1C" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> flat brushes. These brushes are great for pulse and precision work!</p>
