        <p> Precision exercises are some of my favorite things to paint. They are a great warm up exercise, they really help you hone in on brush control, and with variation in color and a little creativity you can create some pretty incredible paintings!</p>
        
        <p> This little blog post goes through my three favorite precision exercises. Get your paints out and get excited! </p>
        
        
        
        <h2> 1. Lines</h2>
        
        <div class="image fit">
            <img src="/images/blog/precision/finishBlue.JPG" alt="finished line precision exercises" />
        </div>
        
        <div class="image fit">
            <img src="/images/blog/precision/pencilBlue.JPG" alt="start blue" />
        </div>
        
        <p> To start off I like creating a grid so I can keep my lines neat and guided. For this line precision exercises I wanted to mix things up and put the lines in a grid. I like to put a quarter inch border around the edges and then broke the remaining space into thirds. </p>
        
        <div class="image fit">
            <img src="/images/blog/precision/startBlue.JPG" alt="start of precision lines" />
        </div>
        
        <p> To start off I suggest you take a smaller brush, I used a size 4, and paint a line. Sounds simple enough, but painting straight lines can be kind of difficult when we are painting them so close together. A little trick I learned is to try to keep your fingers level, that way you brush always has the same pressure and therefore makes the same thickness of line. If you also move your elbow instead of your hand, it is easier to make your lines straight. Try to make the lines have the same amount of white spacing in between. This is by far the most challenging part. </p>
        
        <div class="image fit">
            <img src="/images/blog/precision/bluePalette.JPG" alt="mixing of blue tones" />
        </div>
        
        <p> To make the painting a little more interesting I like to use the same kind of color, but vary the tones. An easy way to do this is to create a space in your palette for mixing all kinds of blue tones. I like to add different blue paints and maybe a bit of green around the palette. Then you can create different mixtures of different tones of paints. Varying tones help create a more interesting painting. </p>
        
        <div class="image fit">
            <img src="/images/blog/precision/middle2Blue.JPG" alt="start of precision lines" />
        </div>
        
        <p> Once youâ€™re done with the first square, continue to fill in the rest, being sure to create the lines in opposite directions to complete the pattern! </p>
        
        
        
        
        
        <h2> 2. Swirl</h2>
        
        <div class="image fit">
            <img src="/images/blog/precision/finishPink.JPG" alt="finished swirl precision exercises" />
        </div>
        
        <div class="image fit">
            <img src="/images/blog/precision/startPink.JPG" alt="start pink" />
        </div>
        
        <p>Alrighty, ready for the second exercise. This one is similar to the first, but it is a little more challenging because instead of straight lines, we deal with a curvy ones. I like to start out with the same quarter inch border again, but no need to break this one into sections. Start off with just one curvy line through the page. I think it makes the piece a little more interesting to start and end at different heights. </p>
        
        
        <div class="image fit">
            <img src="/images/blog/precision/middlePink.JPG" alt="midding of the pink" />
        </div>
        
        <p> Continue to follow your original line around. Try to focus on keeping the same distance between your lines. It becomes more challenging because the lines are curved. I suggest rotating your paper around to make sure you have the best angle.  </p>
        
        
        <div class="image fit">
            <img src="/images/blog/precision/finishPink2.JPG" alt="midding of the pink" />
        </div>
        
        <p> While painting the lines, be sure to also vary the tones of the colors that you decide to use! I used a mixture of pinks, oranges, and mauve for this painting. The more variance in color, the more interesting your painting will look! </p>
        
        
        
        <h2>3. Triangles </h2>
        
        <div class="image fit">
            <img src="/images/blog/precision/finishRed" alt="finished triangle precision exercises" />
        </div>
        
         <p> Last, but not least, we have our triangles. You can easily expand this exercise to include whatever shapes you want, or even just flowing blob shapes. It is whatever your heart desires! </p>
        
        <div class="image fit">
            <img src="/images/blog/precision/startRed" alt="start red" />
        </div>
        
        <p> I chose more of a red color palette with hints of yellow for this painting, I suggest starting in an upper corner and making your way around the paper. You can either make your triangles or shapes all the same size or you can vary them. It is up to you! Both can be interesting. </p>
        
        <div class="image fit">
            <img src="/images/blog/precision/middleRed" alt="middle red" />
        </div>
        
        <p>Continue to create your shapes, filling the page, and focusing on the white space between the shapes. You will want to keep it as uniform as possible, which can be challenging if you are trying to fit together different sizes of shapes. Try your best! </p>
        
        <div class="image fit">
            <img src="/images/blog/precision/middleRed2" alt="middle red2" />
        </div>
        
        <p> When creating your shapes also try to think about how future shapes will fit in. You can kind of see towards the bottom I&apos;ve backed myself into a bit of a corner with a small white space. I eventually fill it with an itty bitty triangle, but I should have really considered what I was doing when I was painting the surrounding shapes. </p>
        
        <h2>Final Thoughts </h2>
        
        <p> These are just the start. Once you do a few of these kinds of paintings you mind starts to wander and you can come up with so many more ideas. Herringbone stripes? Filling in a geometric pattern with these kinds of lines? Doing circles instead of triangles? The ideas are endless! </p>
