        <p> Precision exercises are some of my favorite things to paint. They are a great warm up exercise, they really help you hone in on brush control, and with variation in color and a little creativity you can create some pretty incredible paintings!</p>
        
        <p> This little blog post goes through my three favorite precision exercises. Get your paints out and get excited! </p>

        <h2> 1. Lines</h2>
        
        <div class="image fit">

        </div>
        
        <p> To start off I like creating a grid so I can keep my lines neat and guided. For this line precision exercises I wanted to mix things up and put the lines in a grid. I like to put a quarter inch border around the edges and then broke the remaining space into thirds. </p>
        
        <div class="image fit">

        </div>
        
        <p> To start off I suggest you take a smaller brush, I used a size 4, and paint a line. Sounds simple enough, but painting straight lines can be kind of difficult when we are painting them so close together. A little trick I learned is to try to keep your fingers level, that way you brush always has the same pressure and therefore makes the same thickness of line. If you also move your elbow instead of your hand, it is easier to make your lines straight. Try to make the lines have the same amount of white spacing in between. This is by far the most challenging part. </p>
        
        <div class="image fit">
            <img src="/images/blog/precision/bluePalette.JPG" alt="mixing of blue tones" />
        </div>
        
        <p> To make the painting a little more interesting I like to use the same kind of color, but vary the tones. An easy way to do this is to create a space in your palette for mixing all kinds of blue tones. I like to add different blue paints and maybe a bit of green around the palette. Then you can create different mixtures of different tones of paints. Varying tones help create a more interesting painting. </p>
        
        <div class="image fit">
            <img src="/images/blog/precision/middle2Blue.JPG" alt="start of precision lines" />
        </div>
        
        <p> Once you’re done with the first square, continue to fill in the rest, being sure to create the lines in opposite directions to complete the pattern! </p>

        <h2> 2. Swirl</h2>
        
        <div class="image fit">

        </div>
        
        <p>Alrighty, ready for the second exercise. This one is similar to the first, but it is a little more challenging because instead of straight lines, we deal with a curvy ones. I like to start out with the same quarter inch border again, but no need to break this one into sections. Start off with just one curvy line through the page. I think it makes the piece a little more interesting to start and end at different heights. </p>

        </div>
        
        <p> Continue to follow your original line around. Try to focus on keeping the same distance between your lines. It becomes more challenging because the lines are curved. I suggest rotating your paper around to make sure you have the best angle.  </p>

        </div>
        
        <p> While painting the lines, be sure to also vary the tones of the colors that you decide to use! I used a mixture of pinks, oranges, and mauve for this painting. The more variance in color, the more interesting your painting will look! </p>
