        <p>With the start of the school year, I always find myself a little overwhelmed. The start of the year always comes with dozens of little things that I always feel like I am dramatically trying to keep within arms reach without forgetting. I am typically busy and I always trick myself into thinking that I can function like a normal human being on only 6 hours of sleep.</p>
        
        <p>With this busy schedule, I rarely find that I have time to work on creative things. So when I found a new Instagram creative challenge, I really did push myself to stay on top of the challenge and paint every night (or work ahead if I could). </p>
        
        <div class="image fit">

        </div>
        
        <p>I&apos;ve done a few creative instagram challenges before. If you&apos;ve never seen them before, someone will post a schedule for a month where every day or every other day you post your creative take on the prompt. They usually range in all different mediums. </p>
        
        <div class="image fit">
            <img src="/images/blog/creativeChallenge/landscape.JPG" alt="" />
        </div>
        
        <p>Through these challenges I&apos;ve really pushed myself and took some risks creatively that I would have otherwise not taken. They are a great way to also get yourself out of a creative rut. After a challenge I usually have a ton of creative ideas that I can&apos;t wait to jump on. </p>
        
        <div class="image fit">
            <img src="/images/blog/creativeChallenge/MelDoty.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        
        <p>The challenge that I am currently doing is from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/meldoty.art/">Melissa Doty&apos;s Instagram</a>. Melissa does her work in a series of small squares. For her challenge you simply just follow the prompt and create in a small square, thus the name Mel&apos;s Square-A-Thon, and her hashtag <a target = “_blank” href=”https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/melssat/”>#MelsSAT</a>. </p>
        
        <div class="image fit">
            <img src="/images/blog/creativeChallenge/PPP1.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        
        <p> Last summer when I really started to paint with watercolors, I fell in love with <a target = “_blank” href=”https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/paintingprettypatterns/”>#PaintingPrettyPatterns</a> challenges. The above prompt is the first prompt they ever did. I loved the simplicity and openness of the challenge and how it encouraged geometric patterns and shapes (my favorite!). </p>
        
        <div class="image fit">
            <img src="/images/blog/creativeChallenge/oldPPP1.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        
        <p> Here is a little throw back to some of my work from the challenge! I&apos;m pretty sure this was for the triangle prompt</p>
        
        <div class="image fit">
            <img src="/images/blog/creativeChallenge/PPP2.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        
        <p>They also did a second month. </p>
        
        <div class="image fit">
            <img src="/images/blog/creativeChallenge/PPPHalloween.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        
        <p> And a Halloween theme for October. </p>
        
        <div class="image fit">
            <img src="/images/blog/creativeChallenge/PPPHoliday.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        
        <p> And a Christmas theme for December. </p>
        
        <p> These prompts/challenges were technically done last year, but that doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t follow them again for this year! I wasn't able to do the Christmas challenge last year, but with my love of watercolors and the holiday season, I think I'm going to encourage myself to tackle it this year!<p>
        
        <p> If you have any favorite Instagram creative challenges, please comment below! I am always looking for something new to work on! </p>

                    <p>Painting straight lines and leaving an even amount of white space between color can be really challenging.
